Refyre spec format

[...] denotes a "cluster". 
    - Each file cluster represents a group of files AND folders

'|' specifies various attributes we parse 
    - Implementation-wise, we split the attributes we find inside, and store them
        - for now, each attribute will have to be in the format 'ATTRIBUTE_KEY=ATTRIBUTE_VALUE'
            - for the sake of simplicity, no spaces in between (we'll relax these constraint after a prototype is made)
    
TABS denote hiearchy, as in python (and in the example above - it's an intuitive structure we'd want to keep)

What attributes do we support?
    - dir: the actual, absolute directory path
        - Only required on the highest level directories for now
        - Required to be an absolute path
        - If dir="", we calculate the path ourselves

    - pattern: a regex string that contains a pattern each item in the cluster should follow 
        - Allows people to group variables and files based on a certain pattern
        - Default is ""
        - We only support single patterns for now

    - name: a variable name, in case one seeks to do variable manipulations
        - This is the magic of refyre: 
            - Variables get saved inside our computational structure
            - When we attempt to convert variables, THESE VARIABLES will then be the way users can transport files,
            even though they may be in different places and things. We can also extract information directly based on these
            variables. tldr; THIS IS WHAT EVERYTHING IS BUILDING UP TO!!!

        - Default is "", no variable will be initialized 
        - We only focus on single aliasing for now
        
        - Additional special formatting placed before start of name
            - + symbol means accumulate. If the var has been defined before, it'll add all the file cluster values it found
                - ex: "+dir1" would add any results to variables with the name "dir1"
